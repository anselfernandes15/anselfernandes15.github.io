Of course, if you become failed in the very primary stage, it makes you disappointed very badly. But it will be fine because you can turn your certain defeats into the numerous victories, if you are consistently paying your efforts and loyal to work.Bill gates, only the name is enough to explain his status. He is the founder of Microsoft Corporation and wealthiest person in the world. The richest person in the world and has held the number one position since last many years.  Bill gates has also faced many challenges and failures in his life, especially when he was going to give a new face to his life as an entrepreneur and like other he had also got fail in many things but he did one more thing, he never allowed himself to quit or he never dropped his plan, it was different thing that he didn’t get success in all of them but he had never afraid of getting failure, he executed all of his plans. </span></span>

<span class="style2"><span class="style3">After enrolled in the lakeside school, he always showed a personal interest in the computer programming with one of his friend, Paul Allen. They both well utilized their free time by writing programs and he was strongly attracted towards his interest to write computer programming and excused from his math classes to provoke his interest. He wrote his first program on this machine: an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. In 1974, when popular electronics company MITS (Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry System) hired them the team of two (gates and Allen) after knowing their potential in the programming. Now, Bill Gates completely dropped the Harvard University. Then, Paul Allen and gates joined MITS and designed an Altair emulator and with its success, they resulted a deal with MITS to distribute interpreter as an Altair BASIC. They named their partnership “Micro-Soft”. But gate discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked and after some results, Microsoft discontinued work with MITS and became an independent in 1976 but it still continued to develop programming language and took it at some higher level. </span></span>

<span class="style2"><span class="style3">Another turning point came in the bill gates life, when he was just of 16 years old; he took his little steps in the marketing business world where he failed once again. When bill gates decided to drop Harvard University and work on his strength (computer programming). Traf-O-Data was the name of his first venture with Paul Allen and Paul Gilbert. The main objective was to read the raw data from the roadways traffic counter and create reports for the traffic engineers. They engaged in developing a device to read the traffic tapes for which gates used $3400 money to purchase an Enviro-labs model GS-311 paper tape reader generated by traffic counting and produced some revenue for them so before it had have would happened the state of Washington offered free traffic processing service and ending the need for private contractors and the dream of earning some revenue came to an end. And Traf –O-Data sent letters to all the clients and saying they were suspending business. Few say, this is to be happened because the unexperienced teenagers started this business and the group failed to make an impressive money but in an interview they claimed that, they earned something great than money while doing this business and that was, experience – more valuable than anything else.</span></span></address>

<span class="style2"><span class="style3">With the failure of Traf -O-Data, the bill gates and his teams got a spark of doing something great. Obviously, most of credit for failure went to their age, they were new in the market but they did really well.Traf-O-Data didn’t get a roaring success but bill gates and his team got some more valuable than money and that was, experience.Bill gates failed to complete his education in Harvard University; he decided to give a new face to Microsoft and work on his talent with Paul Allen.</span></span></address>
