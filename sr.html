		Cut To A Guy Who Is So Obsessed With His Girlfriend That He Came To 
		Mumbai And Searched For Her With Only The Information That She Loved 
		Swimming. He Sold His Pentax Camera For Rs 10,000, As He Combed Beaches 
		With Hope And Prayer That He Would Locate Her, Sleeping On The Park 
		Benches, And Cleaning And Bathing In The Hotel Bathrooms. His Friends 
		Lost Hope And Purchased Tickets With The Balance Remaining Money While 
		He For The Last Time Combed The North Mumbai Beaches And Luckily Found 
		Her. Sitting Forlorn At The Marine Drive In Mumbai, He Promised That One 
		Day He Would Rule The City Of Mumbai. In His One Of His First Castings 
		For A Movie Produced And Directed By Arundhati Roy, He Was Given A Role 
		Of An Extra And He Vowed That He Would One Day Win An Oscar Playing A 
		Gay Man. He Came To Mumbai To Act In A Serial And Got Stranded At The 
		Mumbai Airport In The Middle Of The Night As The Person Who Was Supposed 
		To Pick Him Up Overslept, He Cried In The Telephone Booth Thinking That 
		Probably It Was A Hoax While Searching For Some Coins. He Was 
		Recommended For The Role Of Abhimanyu Rai (Fauji)By The Son In-Law Of 
		The Producer Who Was Showing Some Flats To His Mother. The Original 
		Choice Of The Main Lead Was The Producer&#39;s Son Who Was Also The Camera 
		Man In The Serial. </span></span>

		<span class="style2"><span class="style3">He Got The Role As There Was A 
		Logistic Problem Of Handling The Camera And The Role Simultaneously By 
		The Producer&#39;s Son. His Role Became Bigger And Bigger As The Other Co- 
		Stars Threw Tantrums While He Worked Hard To Get The Nuances Right As An 
		Army Officer. This Choice Of Being Always The Second Or The Third Choice 
		Continued With The Movie Baazigar Where The Other Established Starts 
		Like Aamir, Anil Kapoor Were The First Choice, But They Refused To Touch 
		The Movie Where The Main Character Kills Without Any Compunctions And 
		&quot;Is A Murderer In The Movie&quot; The Same Continued With Darr Where He Was 
		Selected With Great Reluctance As No Established Actor Wanted To Be Seen 
		Being Beaten To Pulp At The End In The Movie. Juhi Chawla Shrieked As 
		She Was Persuaded By The Director/Producer That This Actor Was At That 
		Time Going To Be Another Aamir Khan In Making When She Met Him For The 
		First Time During The Shooting Of Darr. She Could Not Get Over The Fact 
		That He Was So Dark With Wild Unruly Hair In Comparison To Aamir And 
		Salman Khan Who Were Recently Launched During The Same Time Both The 
		Movies Were Superhits Blockbuster And He Went On To Bag The Filmfare 
		Best Actor Award For Baazigar . He Went To Meet Abbas- Mastan(Directors 
		Of Bazigar)At 2 O&#39; Clock After The Ceremony At Their Residence In Bhendi 
		Bazaar Chawl And Touched Their Feet. He Initially Refused To Do Dilwale 
		Dulhania Le Jayenge With Aditya Chopra As He Thought Of It As A Romantic 
		Clich?. He Only Agreed To Do It As He Liked The Last Scene Where The 
		Father Lets Go Of The Heroine&#39;s Hand . He Never Wanted To Be The 
		Bollywood Star But A Television Personality Like Oprah Winfrey And 
		Refused Movies In The Beginning. His Fianc? And Later His Wife Had 
		Strong Reservations Against Him Joining The Bollywood . </span></span>

		<span class="style2"><span class="style3">He Grandly Declared That If He 
		Had To Choose Between His Flourishing Career In The Movie Or His Wife. 
		He Would Always Choose His Wife Over Everything Else. He Initially 
		Refused To Do The Movie Chamatkar When The Producer Insisted That He 
		Should Hide His Marriage As Was The Norm At That Time. He Also Refused 
		To Tell A Lie To His In Laws Who Were Dead Against His Marriage To Their 
		Hindu Daughter. His Fianc? And Later Wife Insisted That He Tell His In 
		-Laws That He Has Rs. 6 Lacs In His Bank When He Only Had Rs 28000/- In 
		His Bank Account. He Refused To Do So And Grandly Proclaimed During That 
		Time That Dilip Kumar Had Become Old, Amitabh Bachchan Had Retired And 
		It Was His Time Now To Crowned As The King When He Left Delhi For Mumbai 
		To Start His Career In Bollywood. Gradually, He Became The Superstar 
		Giving One Hit After The Another. He Has Always Charged Lesser Than His 
		Fellow Actors While Doing The Films As He Feels That All The Name And 
		Fame He Has Is Due To The Film Industry And Makes Up With The Brand 
		Endorsements. He Claims That He Can Do Anything -Dance, Shows ... For 
		Money Except Films. Films He Does Only For Love. He Also Went Into 
		Production And Promised To Make Different Kind Of Movies - His First 
		Movie Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani Made With Blood, And Tears Flopped And 
		The Critics, Media Were Savage In Their Attacks. He Also Faced Scary 
		Days When The Mafia Started Targeting Film Wallahs. The Mafia Used To 
		Call Him And Threaten And Chat With Him. With His Common Sense And Smart 
		Wit He Managed To Escape Them. He Has Always Maintained A Tight Balance 
		Between Handling The Mafia And As A Law Abiding Citizen. This Is The 
		Roller Coaster Life Journey Of Todays Superstar Shah Rukh Khan.</span></span></address>
